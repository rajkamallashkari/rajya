**15.3 — Send-arrow attach + schedule.**

Send-arrow menu: attach opens the existing picker and chips; schedule opens
the existing schedule bar. Both actually send. Rewrite and silent stay. Do
not change DS-13. Do not start 15.4 in this session.

## Agent: how to update this file

At the end of your session, replace the "Current state" table and "Next
session brief" with the *next* row from POLISH_PLAN.md §5. Add a row to
"Completed sessions". Do not change anything else.

In the session report, include a proposed commit message (session-id prefix,
e.g. `Session 15.1: …`). Do not create the commit unless the user asks.
